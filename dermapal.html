                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <h3> Users fail to integrate skin health into their daily routines. In a practice like Dermatology, being proactive about skin concerns can mean the difference between a non-invasive procedure or surgery. One of the biggest challenges I faced during my time as a dermatology medical assistant was collaborating with patients to track and trace each of their skin concerns. This experience taught me that people need a way to stay on top of their skin health and wellness, but so often the stresses of work and life get in the way. There is this disconnect between meeting our personal goals VS our healthcare goals. Which sparked the question- How can we better integrate skin health and wellness into a busy lifestyle? </h3>
